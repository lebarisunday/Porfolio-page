    <section>
      <h2 class="border-top">About Lebari</h2>
        <p>After graduating college, I worked for the county of Humboldt. I worked specifically for DHHS in the Public Guardian division. I worked as a vocational assistant. My goal at the time was to try and become a social worker. With the pandemic hitting and source of income diminishing. Me and my wife decided to move to Reno, NV in search of better opportunities.</p>

        <p>I've always been into computer developement and gaming. I can fix gaming console and many other devices. I finally built a huge interest in the IT industry seeing how I already have the talent. I am with Thinkful to help build my skills and succeed in this field as a student. I've begun my journey to becoming a software developer and couldn't be happier!</a>

        <p>I am in the market as a new developer and aslo if you're looking for a somone to work with please reach out! I am very happy and can't wait to work with other developers. We are going to build awesome software.</p>
