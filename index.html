        <p>After graduating college, I worked for the county of Humboldt. I worked specifically for DHHS in the Public Guardian division. I worked as a vocational assistant. My goal at the time was to try and become a social worker. With the pandemic hitting and source of income diminishing. Me and my wife decided to move to Reno, NV in search of better opportunities.</p>

I finally built a huge interest in the IT industry seeing how I already have the talent. I am with Thinkful to help build my skills and succeed in this field As a student at <a href="http://thinkful.com">Thinkful</a>, I've begun my journey to becoming a software developer and couldn't be happier!</a>
